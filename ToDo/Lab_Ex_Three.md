## Lab Exercise Three. Week :four:


### You must have completed [Lab Ex 2](Lab_Ex_Two.md) before attemtping this exercise.  


  
### 1. Remove all code from the `CustomerRepository` and replace it with the following:

```java
@Repository
public interface CustomerRepository extends JpaRepository<Customer, Long> {

}

```
_`JpaRepository` in Spring Data is a generic interface that provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations (out of the box) for a specific entity type without requiring boilerplate code (that you just removed from the `CustomerREpository`. It also provides pagination (as well as some other features). Pagination, allows you to handle lrge datasets efficientlyâ€”reducing memory load, speeding up queries, and improving user experience by showing results in smaller, manageable chunks_  


_Run your application again,and it should run as before_

### 2. Amend the 'displayAllCustomers' Feature from Lab Ex 2.

_Displaying only data from the `customers` table for each customer_

```html
<tr th:each="customer : ${customerList}">
        <td th:text="${customer.customerId}"></td>
        <td th:text="${customer.firstName} + ' ' + ${customer.lastName}"></td>
        <td th:text="${customer.email}"></td>
        <td th:text="${customer.address}"></td>
        <td th:text="${customer.city}"></td>
    </tr>
```

_Ensure that each `customerID` appears as a [link](https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/articles/standardurlsyntax.html) that when clicked on will provide further information for each `customer`. This is in effect a data drill down_

_In the drill down page, for each `review` that the customer has made; display the the `name` of the product, the review `rating` and the `reviewText`_

If end user enters an invalid customer id (via the url): `customers/drilldown/333333` for example, the controller should redirect to `/customers`
